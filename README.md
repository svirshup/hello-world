# hello-world
I'm doing the guide on github

Hello whoever is reading this. If it's me in the future, that is really cool. I hope you've continued learning github and other languages. I have high hopes that you will use your holiday break this year (xmas 2017) to learn some legit python and not flake out like you have in the past. If it's not me in the future, stop snooping!
